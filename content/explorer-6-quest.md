Why don't the Student Success Team ever play hide and seek? Because good luck hiding when everyone always wants to find you for help!

Why not take a leap of faith and approach a member of the team? You might just discover something invaluable that could help chart the course of your university experience.

Here are some conversation starters:
1. Hello, I'm studying game design and development and just started my first year. What's one campus spot I should definitely know about?

3. Hi, in your opinion where is the best place to eat on campus?
4. Hello, this is my first time on campus. Where is the nearest shop?
