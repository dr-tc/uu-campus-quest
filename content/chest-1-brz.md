In a diagram below, you'll see a grand educational tree,
Find the faculties, how many can there be?
In your chosen branch, how many schools reside?
Count them all, then look far and wide.
Sum up each school in every faculty,
And reveal the total count for all to see!{{< break-start >}}{{< break-end >}}
