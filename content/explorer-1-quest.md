Welcome to Derry/Londonderry's campus reception! You are now in the Martha Magee building, commonly referred to as MD, and affectionately known by students as 'Hogwarts'.

Your quest is to obtain a map of the campus. This map will reveal the university's layout, guiding you through its various paths and buildings.

To commemorate the beginning of your university journey, have a fellow student take a photo of your team outside 'Hogwarts'. If you’re ready for an extra challenge, inquire at reception about activating your student card, then locate and use the card activation beacon at the entrance of 'Hogwarts'.
