Congratulations, explorers! You've successfully found the Student Administration office—well done on navigating your way here. This office is your gateway to essential services and support throughout your academic journey.

Your quest is to take a look at the
{{< styled-link-new-window href="https://www.ulster.ac.uk/student/courses/student-record/proof" >}}Proof of Attendance{{< /styled-link-new-window >}} webpage. It's a mystery as to why you would need Proof of Attendance, or is it? Take a look at the page and then approach a Student Success Ambassador and tell them one of the reasons a **student might need** such a letter.

{{< div-justify >}}With so much to remember, it's easy for things to slip your mind—like your **initial email and network password**. But don't worry, there's help close by. Perhaps the writing is on the wall? Your bonus quest is to find the crucial link that holds the key to retrieving your login details. Once you’ve found it, be sure to bookmark it—you’ll thank yourself later! Make sure and show your **bookmarked webpage** to a Student Ambassador.
