      <description>Preparation by the Student Success Ambassador:
Each team member is to approach a Student Success Ambassador and get a sticky note placed on their back or forehead. Each note has the name of a famous game character written on it. These characters could be from popular video games, board games, or any well-known game.
The aim is for each participant to guess the character’s name on their sticky note by asking questions that can only be answered with &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo;.</description>
